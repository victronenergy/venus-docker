# Dockerized dbus playback + mqtt service

The purpose of this docker is to facilitate UI development, by being simulating
real Victron system(s).

The type of UI development meant here are UIs that relate to Venus OS: the OS on
the Victron GX range of monitoring products.

For example the VRM Portal or the HTML5 App.

Within Venus OS, all data readings gathered by the various drivers (canbus, serial,
and so forth) are made available in its internal databus, D-Bus.

This docker contains D-Bus recordings of several system types, see below. Once installed you can select
one of them. That data is then played back on D-Bus. Its also available on mqtt, since this
Docker includes the same D-Bus to MQTT translation service that is also within Venus OS.

The container can simulate different configurations (different sets of devices connected to it)
of the VenusGX by running different sets of recordings with a simple commandline api.

## Usage

- Install Docker
- Create container with `./build.sh`
- Run the container as an interactive shell with `./run.sh`
  - run `./start_services.sh` within the container to start the mqtt and other services.
  - run `./simulate.sh <simulation>` to start playback.
- Run the container in the background with a simulation with `./run.sh -s <simulation_name>`
  - to kill the container (and to remove it because of the `--rm` option) use `docker kill <container id>`
  - get the container id from the output of the run script or with `docker ps`
  - multiple can be run in parallel in which case the ports are incremented and printed by the script
- For more info run `./run.sh -h`

### Additional arguments

Additional arguments you can pass to `simulate.sh` or `run.sh` include:

  * `--with-solarcharger`: Add a solarcharger to the simulation
  * `--with-pvinverter`: Add a pvinverter to the simulation
  * `--with-tanks`: Add tank sensors to the simulation

### Working inside the container

You can see what data is available in the mqtt by using `mosquitto_sub -t N/#` or use an mqtt spy application. To change values manually use `mosquitto_pub`, but these values are likely to be overridden by an active recording quite quickly.

## Modifying recordings

Recordings can be modified with the following steps:

1. Get the recording desired as a tsv file: `./get_recording_tsv.sh <simulation>`. Simulation must be a simulation in ./simulations/X/\<simulation>.dat
2. Edit acquired tsv
3. Recompile the simulation and replace local simulation file with `./recompile_and_replace_simulation.sh <edited_simulation>.tsv <simulation>` where \<simulation> must be the same simulation file as in step 1

## Systems (simulations)

Battery selection should always be on auto; unless specified differently.

### A) Absolut Navetta 68 installation

2 x Skylla-i chargers
2 x VE.Bus Phoenix Inverter 24/3000 (230V and 120V for USA)

And a few more devices, but they won't be connected to Venus:

1 x Phoenix charger 24/25 (for engines)
1 x BlueSmart 12/30 IP22 (for generators) Which electrical parameters can be monitored with these machines? (device by device) Is it possible to set alarms or change device functions via the interface with Garmin?"
AC Input 1 & 2 settings are (probably) to be configured as not available; we'll find out once we start working on the gui-overview for this.

### DSE) Interactive DSE generator simulation

This mode is a specialty: It runs [dse-modbus-simulator](https://github.com/victronenergy/dse-modbus-simulator/) within the Docker container, which consists of a Modbus TCP server simulating a DSE 4620 generator controller and a web ui, whichs allows to modify register values, enable and disable error codes and simulate an actual run (based on randomized numbers).

When running `./run.sh -s dse`, the web ui will, if no other container is running, get available on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and the Modbus TCP server on `0.0.0.0:502`, so that the generator simulation can be found by GX devices on the same network as the Docker host.

### DSE-HR) Interactive DSE generator simulation – Helper Relay mode

As above, but the controller is not advertising to be controllable via Modbus. Instead, it simulates to be wired up to Relay 1 of Venus OS by watching the `/Relay/0/State` DBus path of `com.victronenergy.system`.

## Using venus-docker with a real Venus device

- On the Venus device, edit your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to allow remote
  connections to forwarded ports:

      GatewayPorts clientspecified

- Restart openssh to make the above take effect:

      svc -t /service/openssh

- On the venus device, stop mosquitto:

      svc -d /service/mosquitto

- On the machine that hosts the venus-docker setup, start a venus-docker
  simulation as you normally would.

- Forward the port to the venus device using ssh. Note the leading `:`:

      ssh -R :9001:localhost:9001 root@192.168.22.75

- Browse to the web application: http://192.168.22.75/app

## Building dbus-spy

A binary copy of dbus-spy is already included in this repo, but should you need
to rebuild it, these are the steps:

    git clone git@github.com:victronenergy/dbus-spy.git
    cd dbus-spy
    git submodule update --init
    cd ..
    docker build -f dockerfile.dbus-spy . -t dbus-spy

Then copy dbus-spy out of a throwaway container by first starting a container:

    docker run -it --rm dbus-spy

Then copy dbus-spy to bin:

    docker cp <container>:/usr/local/bin/dbus-spy bin/dbus-spy
